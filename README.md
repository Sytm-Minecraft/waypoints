Ever had the problem, that you were on a long trip and can't find your base?

You could set a warp with a conventional plugin at your home and simply teleport back. But if you want to keep the survival experience of not being able to
teleport like that, this plugin could be just what your server needs!

## Direction Indicators

So, instead of just bringing the player back where he started, this plugin shows him the direction he has to walk, so he can explore the world even more. To
show the player the direction you can configure multiple direction indicators to guide the player to his destination.

### Bossbar Indicator

A compass will be visible at the top of the screen, with a highlighter marking in which direction the waypoint is

### Beacon

When the waypoint is in render distance, a beacon beam will appear at the location of the waypoint to make it easier to pinpoint the location of the waypoint.

### Trail

The plugin attempts to find a suitable path for you to walk and then shows it to you with particles.

### Hologram

Floating text like in the mods.

### Blinking Block

When the player is closer to the waypoint, the beacon will be replaced with a block sequence that will repeat. This is to help him get to the exact location.

### Compass

It won't get any simpler than that if the player owns a compass. It will have the waypoint as it's target and points into that direction.

### Actionbar Indicator

This is comparable to the compass but doesn't require one. It will show the rough direction with small sections in the action bar of the player. If the player
is too far left, the sections in the right will light up and vice versa.

### Particles

Particles appear at the feet of the player pointing into the direction of the waypoint

## Player tracking

Although disabled by
default, [when enabled](https://github.com/Sytm/waypoints/blob/616d2f6db741d656edb8f5d98bb2d18f32cbe2ca/waypoints/src/main/resources/config.yml#L120) adds a
menu to the GUI where the player can choose another player to track. Now the compass, actionbar indicator and particles will help guide the player to the
tracked player.

- Players can choose to hide themselves in the menu to others (if enabled)
- Players must show themselves to others in order to track a player (if enabled)
- The player that gets tracked receives a notification who started tracking him (if enabled)

## Languages
The plugin is shipping translations for the following languages:
- English
- German
- Italian (by marcotech81)
- Simplified Chinese (partial, by SnowCutieOwO)
- Brazilian Portuguese (partial, by gaugt980131gg2)

And if your language is not there, the plugin is fully translatable

## Other notable features

- Open the GUI by sneaking and right-clicking with a compass (by default)
- Set custom icons for waypoints and folders by clicking on their icon. The item in your main hand will be used
- Limit the amount of waypoints and folders a player can have
- Customizable teleport prices and price increases the more the player teleports (With Vault support)
- Direction indicators customizable
- Items in GUI fully customizable
- SQLite data storage
